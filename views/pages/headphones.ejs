    Headphones have always been a big part of my audio journey. Over the years,
    I’ve owned and listened to a variety of high-end headphones, each with their
    own unique sound and personality.
  </p>
  <ul style="margin: 0.5em;">
    <li>
      <strong>Sennheiser HD800</strong> – Known for their incredible soundstage
      and detail, these are a reference point for many audiophiles. The clarity
      and openness make them perfect for critical listening.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sennheiser HD600</strong> – A classic in the headphone world, the
      HD600 offers a natural and balanced sound that works well for almost any
      genre. They’re comfortable and easy to listen to for hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Focal Radiance</strong> – These limited edition headphones combine
      luxury design with a rich, dynamic sound. The bass is punchy without
      overwhelming the mids and highs, making them fun for modern music.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hifiman Arya</strong> – With their planar magnetic drivers, the
      Aryas deliver a spacious and detailed sound. They’re especially great for
      picking out subtle details in complex tracks.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each pair has taught me something new about how music can be experienced.
    Whether it’s the analytical precision of the HD800 or the musical warmth of
    the Radiance, I love exploring how different headphones shape the way I hear
    my favorite tracks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Someday I would love to own a pair of Focal Utopias. They have been my dream
    pair of headphones ever since I had a chance to demo them in NYC last time I
    visited.
